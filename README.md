##Aim of the project

The aim of the project is to simulate a SARS-CoV-2 virus and analyze the effectiveness of various preventive measures. The following constraints/factors are taken into consideration for the simulation:

-The R-naught and k factor of the disease
-The usage and effectiveness of masks and social distancing
-The prevalence of testing and contact tracing
-The availability and efficacy of the vaccine
-Remote work and schools
-Quarantine
-Group event

The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus is also compared with SARS-CoV.
